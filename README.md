# # HELLO
ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I am Arifin Kusuma. I am a long-time software developer who is currently learning Web technologies. 
As I learn, I will be publishing projects to my GitHub repositories. I may also want to blog about things I learn. 
I hope it will be beneficial for other web development students as well.

- Github repositories: https://github.com/finkusuma-dev.
- Currently learning:  
  ðŸ“™  Responsive web design & development with HTML, CSS, and SASS.  
    (Additionally, I am also learning graphic design for the web. I truly enjoy seeing those amazingly designed websites that are aesthetically pleasing.
    And how everything is put together to create visually appealing online experiences.)  
  ðŸ“™ Languages: Javascript and Typescript.  
  ðŸ“™ Frontend frameworks: React, Svelte.  
  ðŸ“™ Backend framework: NodeJs.
